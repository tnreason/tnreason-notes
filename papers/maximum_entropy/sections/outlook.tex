\section{Outlook}

This is relevant for Parameter Estimation: Instabilities when fitting a mean parameter on a non cube-like face.

Further theory to be investigated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Face representability of randomly drawn polytopes (e.g. expectation of a face rank).
    \item Asymptotic properties for large polytopes (does the average face rank concentrate at an expectation)?
\end{itemize}

Investigate the connection with convex polytope investigations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Facet complexity (the amount of information to specify the face by inequalities) \cite{grotschel_geometric_1993}
\end{itemize}

Border-rank development to resolve the issue of non-elementary faces:
When defining a boarder rank of the activation tensors by limiting \CompActNets{}, then any maximum entropy distribution has border rank 1.

Application in NeSy:
By format selection (i.e. which complexity is required to represent a face).
