\begin{example}[I.i.d. Boolean Variables: Coin toss interpretation]\label{exa:ctHc}
    Let there be $\catorder$ boolean variables $\shortcatvariables$, which are i.i.d. drawn from a positive distribution $\probat{\catvariable}$.
    From the pairwise independencies of $\catvariableof{\catenumerator}$ it follows with the Hammersley-Clifford Factorization Theorem that the distribution is representable by an elementary tensor network, that is
    \begin{align*}
        \probwith = \bigotimes_{\catenumeratorin} \probat{\catvariableof{\catenumerator}} \, .
    \end{align*}
\end{example}
