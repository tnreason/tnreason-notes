\section{Generalizations}

There are two generalization directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kikuchi message passing schemes: Messages are sent between layers of hyperedges (where so far have the hyperedges and their intersections in two layers).
    \item Expectation-propagation on generalized features:
    Hyperedges are understood as sets of features.
    Messages are computed by forward map in the whole inference cluster, and backward map in the message cluster.
    So far: Used only the hybrid indicator features on the edges, for which forward maps are simple contractions.
\end{itemize}
