\section{Alternative Contraction Provider: Overlap-measuring Circuits}

Quantum Circuits such as the SWAP test and the Hadamard test (\cite[Section 3.6.1]{schuld_machine_2021}) can be used to measure overlaps of quantum states, which are the squared absolutes of contractions of two state tensors.
\begin{itemize}
    \item When we have preparation schemes for two tensors, we can control them with a common ancilla qubit and measure their contraction by a Hadamard test (alternatively, using the SWAP test and state preparation in two registers).
    \item Can we extend these schemes to contractions of more general tensor networks?
\end{itemize}
