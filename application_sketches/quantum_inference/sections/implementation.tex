\section{Implementation}

The introduced quantum circuit preparation schemes have been implemented in the python package \qcreason{}, which consists in three layers:

\subsection{Generic Contraction}

So far, the generic contraction routine consists in activation circuits preparing for each tensor an ancilla variable, and post-selecting the measurements where the ancilla variable is $1$.
The resulting tensor of the contraction is a $\mathrm{PandasCore}$ storing the post-selected measurement results in a dataframe.
