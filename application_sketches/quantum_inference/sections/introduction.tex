\section{Introduction}

By its central axioms, quantum mechanics of multiple qubits is formulated by tensors capturing states and discrete time evolutions.
Motivated by the structural similarity, we investigate how quantum circuits can be utilized for the tensor-network based approach towards efficient and explainable AI in the \tnreason{} framework.

We follow two main ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sampling of \ComputationActivationNetworks{}:} Prepare quantum states, which measurement statistics can be utilized to prepare samples from \ComputationActivationNetworks{}.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Circuits as Contraction providers:} Quantum circuits are contractions of multiple tensors and therefore tensor networks, and measurement probabilities are given by contractions.
    Here we investigate how we can exploit these as contraction provider for \tnreason{}.
\end{itemize}

Main approach: Quantum Inference scheme on Bayesian networks \cite{low_quantum_2014}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend to more general tensor networks than Bayesian networks: \ComputationActivationNetworks{}
\end{itemize}
