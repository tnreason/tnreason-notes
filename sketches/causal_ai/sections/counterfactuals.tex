\section{Rung 3: Counterfactuals}

Following the formalism of Chapter~21 in \cite{koller_probabilistic_2009}, counterfactual queries are modeled as intervention queries on counterfactual twin networks.
Counterfactual twin networks are two copies of the original causal model, one representing the factual world and one representing the counterfactual world.
They further share response variables, which capture the functional relationships between variables in the causal model.
These response variables are modeled as selection variables in the \tnreason{} formalism.
