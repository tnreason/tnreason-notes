\section{Introduction}

% Classical TN contractions
Tensor network contractions have been identified as central inference mechanism of neuro-symbolic AI in \cite{goessmann_tensor_2026}.
However, their exact execution is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard, and one either has to restrict itself to feasible situations, or apply approximations.

% Quantum
We in this work investigate, how specific contractions (especially forward inference on \ComputationActivationNetworks{}) can be performed more efficiently on a Quantum Computer.
